# Hashtables
Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
Challenge
Write a function called TreeIntersection that takes two binary trees as parameters. Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:
✓ Should return a tree intersection.

✓ Should return a tree intersection.

✓ Should return a tree intersection.
