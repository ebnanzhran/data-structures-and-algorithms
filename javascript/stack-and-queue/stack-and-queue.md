# Stacks and Queues

### A stack: is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).

### Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology.


## Challenge

### Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue by using linked list.


## Approach & Efficiency

* O(1) for both stack and queue
