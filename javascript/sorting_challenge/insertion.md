# Insrtion Sort 

## Code 
```
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let currentValue = arr[i];
    let j;
    for (j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentValue; j--) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
    }
    arr[j + 1] = currentValue;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.


## Write tests to prove the following functionality:
✓ Sample arrays.

✓ Reverse-sorted.

✓ Few uniques.

✓ Nearly-sorted.
