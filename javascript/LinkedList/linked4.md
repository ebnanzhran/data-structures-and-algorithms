## Code chalenge class 06
### Challenge:
create a linked list class that has methods to append, insert before, and insert after nodes.
Approach & Efficiency:
The Big O time is O(n)
Space is O(1)

## Singly Linked List

### LinkedList :
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointersas shown in the below image:



In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

What i learned in this challenge:
I leaned hoe can i create a linked list and how added a tail.

### Test driven :
Create a LinkedList!
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Can properly insert into the LinkedList?
Is return all value in LinkedList?
Is the head property in the first node in LinkedList?
Is Search done 
### Approach & Efficiency:
Used Classes to implement the linked list with the O(1) and O(n) from data strucher that i leaned in past class for it methods .

## Linked List Kth From End
need to create a link list constructor class along with method to do the desired search action

### Challenge
create a linked list class that has a method to append nodes simply to have something to work with and a method used to search for specific nodes in the linke list and return the value

### Approach & Efficiency:
The Big O time is O(n)
Space is O(1)
